# Memory-Game-In-Java

The task at hand is to implement a Java program that simulates a simplified version of the memory board game. This game consists of 2*N cards, forming N pairs of pictures. The cards are randomly placed face down on the table. Players take turns flipping over two cards each round. If the cards match, the player scores a point and the cards are removed. If they don't match, the cards are closed and the next player continues. The game ends when all pairs have been found. The player with the most points wins. In this simplified version, the cards are numbers from 0 to N-1. The game can be played between a human player and a computer player or between two human players. The human player chooses the two cards to flip over using a tactic described in the text. The implementation requires the creation of four classes: Board, ComputerPlayer, HumanPlayer, and MemoryGame. The Board class holds information about the table and cards, the ComputerPlayer class handles the computer player's moves, the HumanPlayer class handles the human player's moves, and the MemoryGame class handles the overall flow of the game.
